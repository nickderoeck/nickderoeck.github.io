Electricity is the lifeblood of an electric car, and knowing how, when and where to charge it, is absolutely vital.
The most obvious place to charge it is at home.<br>

<h2>How to charge</h2>
My car has a 90 kWh battery, and is using about 25 kWh per 100 kilometers driven, so after about 360km, it's done.<br>

So in order to not to get stranded somewhere, it is important to keep the battery charged.<br>

<br><img loading='lazy' alt='The Battery' src='2020-12-31-charging.jpg' /><br>

Getting this battery back to 100% after a long drive, or during a long drive will be necessary if 'movement' is the goal ;-)<br>

<h2>Charging at home</h2>
<h3>Mobile home charger via standard 230V AC grid</h3>
The car comes with a mobile home charger that works with the standard 230V AC electricity grid that we have at home.
The charger has a 'Type 2' connector on one side (aka 'Mennekes'), and a regular schuko plug on the other side that nicely plugs into a wall socket.<br>

<br><img loading='lazy' alt='Type 1 Home Charger' src='2020-12-31-charging-lader-type1.jpg' /><br>

This works great, I used it myself last week. But there is a snag ... it is slow.<br>

A standard home charger draws 10A from a socket; at 230V this gives 2300W (2,3 kW).
The battery can hold 90kWh; so it takes 90kWh / 2,3 kW = 39 hours(!) to fully charge from 0% to 100%.
With an estimated 360km for a full battery, charging via this home charger gives 9km of extra range per hour.
Like I said, slow; but also cheap, home electricity is one of the cheapest sources: 0.25 EU per kWh, or EU 22,5 EU for a full charge (0,0625 EU per km).<br>

Of course, one will (should) never end up at 0% at home, and it is also not needed to go to a full 100% charge in the morning.
The car is parked in the garage during the night for 12h; so as long as I do not drive more than 100km per day, this will work out fine.<br>

<h3>Home wallbox charger via standard 230V AC grid</h3>
To improve the home charging speed, it is possible to install a dedicated wallbox in your garage or next to your parking spot.<br>

<br><img loading='lazy' alt='Type 1 Home Charger' src='2020-12-31-charging-wallbox.jpg' /><br>

This can be plugged into a 16A 230V socket; or even a 32A 230V socket if available.<br>

The speed gain is impressive:
<ul>
<li>16A x 230V = 3680W; charging at 15km/hour; a full charge in 25 hours
<li>32A x 230V = 7360W; charging at 30km/hour; a full charge in 12 hours 30 minutes
<li>compare to the regular home charger: 10A x 230V = 2300W; charging at 9km/hour; a full charge in 39 hours
</ul><br>

A home wallbox is clearly the way to go, so I'm installing it.<br>

The I-Pace model that I have can only charge on a 1-phase AC connection of 230V; with a maximum of 7,36kW.<br>

The newer models support 3-phase AC at 400V also, which allows faster charging speeds if one uses a 3-phase AC connection.<br>

<h2>Charging on the road</h2>
Of course while 360km of range is plenty for day to day driving, it is not enough when going for a longer trip.
For this charging on the road is needed, and I will tackle this in my next post.<br><br>Tags: <a href="/ev">ev</a> <a href="/ndr">ndr</a> <br>Links: <a href="2020-12-31-charging.html">Permalink</a> - <a class="twitter-share-button" target="new" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Charging at home - https%3A%2F%2Ftermuden.be/2020-12-31-charging.html" data-size="large">Tweet</a><br>Previous: <a href="/2020-12-28-going-electric.html">Going Electric</a><br><br>&copy; 2020-12-31, Nick De Roeck.
